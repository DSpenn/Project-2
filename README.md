# Project-2
<!---USER STORY--->
As a user I want to sign in to an app that stores and tracks fitness goals.
As a user I want to be able to save my own fitness routines, or select something
from a pre formed list.
As a user I want to track what excercises I do during a day, or set reminders (some sort of calendar function)
As a user I want the app to build and securely save my profile (including what I did, when, reps, set, etc.)
As a user I want to be able to add notes or comments to the stuff somewhere in the app (maybe).
